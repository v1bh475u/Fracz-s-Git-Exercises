In this exercise, we wanted to fix some bug in previous commit. We created a branch from that commit and continued our work on original branch.

But then we felt that the bug is annoying to work with. 

We now want to shift our work from this branch to the branch where the bug is fixed.

For this, we used `git rebase <branch>`.

This command allows us to add commits that were done after branching on the specified branch.
